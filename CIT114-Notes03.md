**Notes03 - DevOps**

On Etsy, they would test changes on a try server that was identical to organization's production continous integration (CI) 

*Continous integration*

Not requiring any code to be committed to the master branch 

*Push queue*

Local and try test have passed to deploy changes to production

*Deployinator*

Deploys changes to the QA

*Nagios*

Checks, monitors, and alerts people of the tests

*First Push Program*

A program that encourages engineers and non engineer members to push code onto production

*Svn merge*

Known for not being the easiest merging tool to work with

*Effective devops*

Organization that embraces cultural change to affect how individuals think about work, value all the different roles that individuals have, accelerate business value, and measure the effects of the change

*Devops*

A cultural movement that changes how individuals think about their work, values the diversity of work done, supports intentional processes that accelerate the rate by which businesses realize value, and measures the effect of social and technical change

*Folk model*

Term used with different intent that leads to miscommunication and misunderstanding. 

*Situational awareness*

Often used as a stand-in for more specific ideas like perception and short-term memory

Around 1961 NASA needed to find someone to write the flight software to accomplish the task in which they enlisted Margaret Hamilton

In the Apollo 11 mission, the lunar module guidance computer software was tasked with too many calculations for its limited capacity so Hamiltonâ€™s team had to program the software such that it could be manually overridden

*Set of requirements*

Debugging all individual requirements
Testing individual components prior to assembly
Integration testing

*Priority displays*

Software that alerts astronauts to information that requires their attention in real time. 

*Nato Science Committee*

In 1967 they formed a A Study Group on Computer Science to indentify key problems with software engineering
It included: defining and measuring success, building complex systems requiring large investment and unknown feasibility, producing systems on schedule and to specification, and putting economic pressures on manufacturers to build specific products

*International Business Machines (IBM)*
Designed computers known as the System/360
Designed to support a wide range of utility from small to large and for commercial and scientific purposes.
The goal was to reduce the cost of product development, manufacturing, service, and support
Enabled job flexibility

*Usenet*
Started in 1979 by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis
Started as simple shell script that would automatically call different computers, search for changes in files, and copy changes from one computer to another using *UUCP* (Unix-to-Unix copy, a suite of programs allowing for file transfer and remote command execution between computers).

*DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society*
Founded in 1961 consisted mostly of programmers who wrote code for or maintained DEC computer equipment

*Trade Secret*
Information that is not generally known to the public 

*Proprietary*
Information a company possesses, owns, or holds exclusive rights to

*Apache Software*
Enabled anyone to quickly deploy a web server with minimal configuration.

*Open Source Software*
Allow users to read, modify, and distribute its source code

*PHP*
Allowed developers to create dynamic websites and applications

*Crystal Clear*
Software development methodology for small teams
Frequent delivery of usable code, moving toward smaller, and more frequent deployments rather than large
Reflective improvement, or using reflections on what worked well and what worked poorly in previous work to help guide future work
Osmotic communication between developers

*Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)*
Providing virtualized compute instances and storage through a proprietary service

*Hallway Track*
Phrase often used to describe the interactions and conversations that take place in the hallways of conferences

*Four pillars of effective devops*
Collaboration
Affinity
Tools
Scaling
The four pillars of effective devops will allow you to solve both cultural and technical problems that can impact software development

*Collaboration*
Process of building toward a specific outcome through supporting interactions and the input of multiple people

*Affinity*
Process of building these interteam relationships, navigating differing goals or metrics while keeping in mind shared organizational goals, and fostering empathy and learning between different groups of people

*Tools*
An accelerator, driving change based on the current culture and direction

*Scaling*
A focus on the processes and pivots that organizations must adopt throughout their lifecycles

**Question 2**

>Tests went from being flaky wastes of time to helping catch bugs. Logs, graphs, and alerts made it possible for everyone, not just a select few individuals, to see the impact of their work.

This stood out to me because I remember reading about the first actual bug was caught in their system that caused some errors. Testing was mainly done in science, but had expanded to other industries to prevent any errors before allowing it to be in public hands. Prevent the error before it expands.


>In an environment where humans are blamed and punished for errors, a culture of fear can build up walls that prevent clear communication and transparency.

Reading through the chapter and how life has evolved, there was a lot of firing happening if you made one mistake. I always thought that was dumb because everyone makes mistakes as no one is perfect. You learn from mistakes. Today, some people still fear of making mistakes because they don't want to loose their job, but most companies aren't extreme and take those mistakes as a learning objective.

**Question 4**
The question that I have is, how would systems opperate and run if DevOps was not created? Would there still be two seperate teams not communicating and everything will have a slow process?
